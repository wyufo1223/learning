Running the broker

From the binary distribution you can run the Apache ActiveMQ server via the bin/activemq command. If you're using Windows, just type

    cd bin
    activemq.bat start
On Unix-like systems, type

    ./bin/activemq console
to start the broker in foreground.

The Apache ActiveMQ broker should now have started

Tip: If you run the bin/activemq command without any arguments it will output usage.

To stop the broker you can press ctrl + c to stop the process.
Running the broker in the background

The broker can be started as a background process via the bin/activemq command on Unix-like systems, type

    ./bin/activemq start
to start the broker in background. The broker will write to its log in the data/activemq.log file.

Stopping the broker

The broker can be stopped via the bin/activemq command If you're using Windows, just type

    cd bin
    activemq.bat stop
On Unix-like systems, type

    ./bin/activemq stop
to stop the broker.

Access the web console

In a web browser you can access the url http://0.0.0.0:8161/admin to access the ActiveMQ web console. 
The broker may ask for credentials to login the web console the first time. The default username and password is admin/admin. You can configure this in the conf/jetty-real.properties file.
Access the web demos

You would need to start the broker with the demos included, which you do as follows: If you're using Windows, just type
    cd bin
    activemq.bat console xbean:examples/conf/activemq-demo.xml
On Unix-like systems, type

    ./bin/activemq console xbean:examples/conf/activemq-demo.xml
In a web browser you can access the url http://0.0.0.0:8161/demo to access the ActiveMQ web demos. 
The broker may ask for credentials to login the web console the first time. The default username and password is admin/admin. You can configure this in the conf/jetty-real.properties file.
Running the example programs

To run the demo producer/consumer tools, you need Java and Ant installed.

Installing Ant

The example programs depend on Ant being installed. There are more detailed instructions on the Ant website - but essentially you need to follow these steps.

JAVA_HOME must point to your JDK installation, such that $JAVA_HOME/bin contains the java executable and $JAVA_HOME/lib contains some jar files.
ANT_HOME must point to where you installed Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)
then you need to add $JAVA_HOME/bin and $ANT_HOME/bin to your PATH variable.
To test this is all working, try typing

    java -version
    cd examples/openwire/swissarmy
    ant -version
Running the example producer and consumer

Once you've got Java and Ant installed correctly you should be able to run

    cd examples/openwire/swissarmy
    ant consumer
and in another shell

    cd examples/openwire/swissarmy
    ant producer
you can specify exact URLs to connect to via command like arguments. e.g.

    ant producer -Durl=tcp://somehost:port
